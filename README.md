# Tableau Dashboard Overview

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard visualizing sales and profit data across different regions, categories, and customer segments within the United States. The dashboard provides several interactive views to explore these key business metrics.

## Dashboard Views

The dashboard includes the following views:

* **Barchart (Sales by Region):** A vertical bar chart displaying the total sales for each region (Central, East, South, West). This allows for a quick comparison of sales performance across different geographical areas.
* **Pie Chart (Sales Distribution):** A pie chart illustrating the proportion of total sales contributed by each region. This provides a clear understanding of the sales distribution.
* **Side by Side Bars (Profit and Sales by Category and Segment):** This section contains side-by-side bar charts showing both Profit and Sales for different product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) further broken down by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). This enables a detailed analysis of profitability and sales volume for specific product and customer combinations.
* **Horizontal Plot (Profit Over Time):** A horizontal plot visualizing the profit trend over different order dates. This helps identify patterns and changes in profitability over time.
* **Map (Sales by State):** A geographical map of the United States where states are colored based on their sales performance. Hovering over a state likely provides specific sales figures for that region.

## Data Visualized

The dashboard utilizes the following key measures and dimensions:

* **Measures:**
    * **Sales:** The total revenue generated from sales.
    * **Profit:** The net profit after deducting costs.
    * **Value:** Used in the side-by-side bar chart to represent both Profit and Sales.

    * **Region:** The geographical region of the sales.
    * **Category:** The product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).
    * **Segment:** The customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
    * **Order Date:** The date when the order was placed.
    * **State:** The individual state within the United States.
    * **Measure Names:** Used to differentiate between Profit and Sales in the side-by-side bar chart.
    * **Segment:** Used as a color encoding in the side-by-side bar chart.

* **Hover over elements:** To see specific values and details.
